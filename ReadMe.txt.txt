 Precious Salvador | Personal Portfolio Website 🎨
_______________________________________________

This is my personal website created as part of my Web Applications coursework. It is based on my previously designed paper and digital wireframes and showcases my work as a freelance illustrator and animator.

 Design Choices & Deviations

- Social Media Placement: Moved icons to the Contact section for clearer user flow, instead of placing them in the header or footer.
- Portfolio Expansion: Implemented modal-style image enlarging for cleaner image viewing experience.
- Back Navigation Button: Added a return arrow for user-friendly navigation when an image is expanded.
- Minimalist Styling: Chose a soft, neutral theme to allow artworks to stand out more, aligning with personal branding.

 Hero Section Enhancement**:
  - Increased heading and subtitle size to visually complement the background.
  - Applied a `min-height: 100vh` layout to fill the screen and feel immersive.
